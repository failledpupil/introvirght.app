- **Single router implementation** (removed test routers)
- **Error boundaries** for robust error handling
- **Consistent component patterns** throughout

## 🗂️ What Was Removed

### Demo & Development Components (24 files)
- `DemoPage.tsx`, `VAPIThemeDemo.tsx`, `AnimationDemo.tsx`
- `LogoShowcase.tsx`, `SimpleAppRouter.tsx`
- Multiple onboarding variants (3 components → 1)
- Duplicate AI assistants (3 components → 1)
- Experimental features (11 incomplete components)
- Animated UI variants (3 duplicate components)

### Unused Utilities & Hooks (6 files)
- `id.ts`, `typography.ts`, `themeValidation.ts`
- `useAutoSave.ts`, `useDebounce.ts`, `useLoadingState.ts`

### Theme System Simplification
- Removed complex `ThemeCustomizer` component
- Simplified from 15+ themes to 4 essential themes
- Merged `themeStore` + `enhancedThemeStore` → `unifiedThemeStore`
- Removed VAPI theme customization UI

### Dependencies Cleaned (8 packages)
- `@tailwindcss/postcss`, `@tailwindcss/typography`
- `@types/react-router-dom`, `events`, `lucide-react`
- `uuid`, `@vercel/node`
- Unused npm scripts removed

## 🏗️ New Architecture

### Component Structure
```
src/components/
├── core/           # Essential app components
│   ├── AppRouter.tsx
│   ├── ErrorBoundary.tsx
│   ├── Onboarding.tsx
│   └── PageLoader.tsx
├── pages/          # Page components
├── ui/             # Reusable UI components
├── layout/         # Layout components
├── branding/       # Logo and branding
└── animations/     # Animation components
```

### Unified Systems
- **Single theme store** with backward compatibility
- **Consolidated UI components** (Button, Input, Card, Text)
- **Unified CSS** with essential styles only
- **Error boundaries** for graceful failure handling

## 🚀 Performance Features

### Code Splitting
```typescript
// Lazy loaded optional features
const AnalyticsView = lazy(() => import('../pages/AnalyticsView'));
const AIAssistantView = lazy(() => import('../pages/AIAssistantView'));
const AstraDBManagement = lazy(() => import('../pages/AstraDBManagement'));
```

### Bundle Optimization
```typescript
// Vite manual chunking
manualChunks: {
  vendor: ['react', 'react-dom', 'react-router-dom'],
  editor: ['@tiptap/react', '@tiptap/starter-kit'],
  ui: ['zustand', 'clsx', 'tailwind-merge'],
  optional: ['@datastax/astra-db-ts', 'openai']
}
```

### CSS Optimization
- Removed 1700+ lines of redundant CSS
- Kept only essential animations and styles
- Optimized VAPI theme variables
- Consolidated duplicate keyframes

## ✅ Quality Assurance
